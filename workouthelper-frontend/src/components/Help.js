                <Card.Text>
                When you complete a workout, you can save one (1) parameter for each workout. E.g.
                the reps for an exercise. Also by using your imagination, you can save pretty much
                any parameter you want. If you want to keep track of let&rsquo;s say the water
                temperature of a lake, then you would save the temperature measurement as the one
                parameter of this &rsquo;workout&rsquo; if you will. Fragments can be saved as
                .5002 or 90.01 up to 38 decimal places (.00000000000000000000000000000000000000).
                Use dots [.] instead of commas [,].
                  <br />
                  <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faInfo} color="blue" /> NB You can save a number in the range
                of [-999999999999999999999999999999999999999, 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999].
                If you change the unit used in some of the results, it will mess up the statistics, so
                be careful. Best practice would be to use the same unit of measure e.g. feet throughout
                the workout history. Furthermore if you change new result number and then click the Save
                button for the Selected Workout, it will not overwrite the previous result of this
                workout.

                Here you can again use your imagination to set up whatever kinds of notes you want
                for you workout. As an example, you could write down the date when something
                remarkable happened like &rsquo;2.2.2021 I made my personal best of 25 Bench presses,
                thanks to 5 weeks of progressive overload to the upper body.&rsquo;.

                are going to measure, e.g. Exercise, Guitar, School, Temperature, Racetrack or
                Competition just to name a few. It would be beneficial to be specific about the title
                of the measured activity. To include used weights, target time frame or used physical
                measurement units in the likes of Bench press 132 lb 1 min, Chord changes A-D 2 min,
